  <b>Quote:</b>  “I don't care. Not in the sense that I don't think it's serious or that it's not a problem. But I don't care in the sense that I don't want to be getting involved in whatever side people are working themselves up about, because the problem is much deeper than that. We have to pay attention to the deeper problem, both in the human condition and politically.”  [<a href = "../tags/human.html">Human</a>]
