  The Abhayagiri Monastic Thanksgiving retreat was traditionally an annual ten-day residential retreat held at the Angela Center in Santa Rosa, California during the week of Thanksgiving. However, after the Angela Center closed due to fire damage in 2017 and the COVID pandemic began in 2020, the location, date, duration, and format of this retreat have varied significantly.
