    <li>[<a href="Audio/10_AP_11_23_2015_TMR_Q_A.mp3" title="Monday, November 23 – Evening – Questions and Answers 3">6:27</a>] Inclining mind toward happiness, joy, lightness, exhilaration, the good, sometimes feels a bit Polyanna-ish. What about all the wars, refugees, my job, illness, pain, etc. Aren't these also the way things are – unpleasant, dark, and negative?</li>

However, it seems to be leaking during every other activity. Walking to the meal, in my room, going to the bathroom, eating. Help! I seem to be defeating my own efforts.</li>

    <li>[<a href="Audio/10_AP_11_23_2015_TMR_Q_A.mp3" title="Monday, November 23 – Evening – Questions and Answers 3">25:53</a>] Could you offer a bit of advice on how to deal with the apparent dichotomy between seeing people (including myself) as real & solid (for example when sending them metta), and the doctrine of no-self whereby there is no such imagined solidity at all – just an ever-changing combination of the khandas?</li>
    <li>[<a href="Audio/10_AP_11_23_2015_TMR_Q_A.mp3" title="Monday, November 23 – Evening – Questions and Answers 3">30:44</a>] What if a short breath never comes? Am I stuck on the long breath or can I create a short breath and move on? Are the steps to anapanasati sequential, and do I observe them, cultivate them, or both?</li>
    <li>[<a href="Audio/10_AP_11_23_2015_TMR_Q_A.mp3" title="Monday, November 23 – Evening – Questions and Answers 3">35:54</a>] How does one avoid controlling the breath when observing it?</li>

    <li>[<a href="Audio/10_AP_11_23_2015_TMR_Q_A.mp3" title="Monday, November 23 – Evening – Questions and Answers 3">46:46</a>] Does the breath body exist as an object of mind? As the Buddha mentions it so specifically, I would be grateful for more clarification on the “breath body.”</li>
    <li>[<a href="Audio/10_AP_11_23_2015_TMR_Q_A.mp3" title="Monday, November 23 – Evening – Questions and Answers 3">51:02</a>] I notice that the calmer my mind becomes, the more imperceptible my breath is – to the point of feeling a suspension of breathing and at times a complete cessation. This sometimes seems to lead to sleepiness and torpor. How can I bring my mind back to a state of focus without manipulating my breath?</li>
    <li>[<a href="Audio/10_AP_11_23_2015_TMR_Q_A.mp3" title="Monday, November 23 – Evening – Questions and Answers 3">56:05</a>] When negative feelings arise, whether they be fear, anxiety, loneliness, etc., how do we investigate them? Does breathing into these feelings and being fully present (without trying to push them away) help to become aware of the true cause of these feelings? Is the cause of these feelings always craving of some kind?</li>

      As the retreatants prepare to move out into their day-to-day lives, Ajahn Pasanno speaks of balancing the external and internal aspects of the practice, whether in finding the balance of spiritual friendship and inner development or in balancing the keeping of precepts and the cultivation of right view.

      Ajahn Pasanno begins the closing ceremony with an explanation of the Paritta chanting, protective chants that include the Metta Sutta, The Mangala Sutta, and the Ratana Sutta. Ajahn Ñāniko then begins the Paritta chanting by calling on the devas, forces of goodness, to witness. The Paritta chants are followed by a ceremony of blessing cords and a sprinkling of holy water. Ajahn Pasanno then offers a brief reflection on the importance of skillful endings and the retreat concludes with all retreatants chanting together the Sharing of Blessings.

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Luang Por Pasanno and the Abhayagiri Community created a monastic environment and offered retreatants an opportunity explore the Dhamma in a setting that differs somewhat from a typical meditation retreat.</p>
  <p>The retreatants followed the Eight Precepts, took only what is offered, and attempting to reflect on our every activity as part of our practice. In addition, there was noble silence, morning and evening chanting, sitting and walking meditation, a work period, and daily Dhamma talks and teachings.</p>
  <p>The retreat was held from Friday afternoon, November 20, through midday Sunday, November 29, 2015, in the Ursula Hall at the Angela Center in Santa Rosa, California.</p>
