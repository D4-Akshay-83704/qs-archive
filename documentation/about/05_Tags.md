# Tags
The archive uses a hierarchical scheme to organize the over 300 tags it employs. This scheme follows the structure of the Pāli teachings when possible, but I have needed to invent new categories for modern subjects. Mirroring the structure of the teachings, individual tags often appear multiple times in the hierarchy. For example, [[Equanimity](../../pages/tags/equanimity.html)] (upekkha) appears as a factor of [[Right Concentration](../../pages/tags/right-concentration.html)] and in the lists of [[Factors of Awakening](../../pages/tags/factors-of-awakening.html)], [[Divine Abidings](../../pages/tags/divine-abidings.html)], and [[Perfections](../../pages/tags/perfections.html)]. One can explore the tag hierarchy by starting with the [root tags](../../pages/drilldown/tag-999.html) and successively expanding them to reveal the subtags they contain.

## Tag Structure

The superstructure of the tagging scheme can be understood by examining this grouping of the 16 root tags:

__A. Mental qualities__

1. [Skillful qualities](../../pages/drilldown/tag-000.html#0)
2. [Unskillful qualities](../../pages/drilldown/tag-168.html#168)
3. [Indeterminate qualities](../../pages/drilldown/tag-211.html#211)

 __B. Modes of practice__

4. [Three Refuges](../../pages/drilldown/tag-266.html#266)
5. [Devotional practice](../../pages/drilldown/tag-273.html#273)
6. [Precepts](../../pages/drilldown/tag-291.html#291)
7. [Meditation](../../pages/drilldown/tag-316.html#316)

 __C. Sources of Dhamma teachings__

8. [Teaching Dhamma](../../pages/drilldown/tag-390.html#390)
9. [Teachers](../../pages/drilldown/tag-427.html#427)
10. [Monasteries](../../pages/drilldown/tag-494.html#494)

 __D. Context of teaching and and practice__

11. [Nature of the cosmos](../../pages/drilldown/tag-517.html#517)
12. [History](../../pages/drilldown/tag-539.html#539)
13. [Cultural context](../../pages/drilldown/tag-551.html#551)
14. [Spiritual traditions](../../pages/drilldown/tag-571.html#571)

 __E. Domains of teaching and practice__

15. [Renunciant practice](../../pages/drilldown/tag-583.html#583)
16. [Everyday life](../../pages/drilldown/tag-651.html#651)

As in the teachings themselves, the tag structure gives first priority to understanding skillful and unskillful stages of mind. Next come strategies for cultivating skillful states of mind and details about the transmission of the teachings, followed by tags describing the context within which this all occurs.

Tags are organized chronologically and conceptually; earlier and more fundamental tags come first. For example, the subtags of [Skillful qualities](../../pages/drilldown/tag-000.html#0) begin by following the order of explanation in the [Buddha’s first teaching](https://www.abhayagiri.org/media/books/Chanting-Book-Vol-1-Web.pdf#page=110): [[Middle Path](../../pages/tags/middle-path.html)], [[Noble Eightfold Path](../../pages/tags/eightfold-path.html)], [[Four Noble Truths](../../pages/tags/four-noble-truths.html)]. This is followed by the [[Aids to Awakening](../../pages/tags/aids-to-awakening.html)], the Buddha’s own summary of his teachings comprising seven sets of skillful qualities, totalling 37 qualities in all. Next come the sets contained with the Aids to Enlightenment that are not contained within the Eightfold Path itself: [[Four Bases of Success](../../pages/tags/bases-of-success.html)], [[Five Faculties](../../pages/tags/faculties.html)], [[Seven Factors of Awakening](../../pages/tags/factors-of-awakening.html)]. Following this are two canonical and one early post-canonical list: [[Divine Abidings](../../pages/tags/divine-abidings.html)], [[Seven Treasures](../../pages/tags/treasures.html)], and [[Ten Perfections](../../pages/tags/perfections.html)]. 


## Alternative Translations, Glosses and Subsumed Tags
Over the years, many Pāli terms have been translated into English in a multitude of ways. The primary English translation chosen for each tag corresponds to my understanding of how Ajahn Pasanno generally uses the term. The Archive also includes alternative translations which either shed light on nuances of the Pāli term or have been widely used. There are also English words and phrases which roughly approximate Pāli terms and thus receive the corresponding Pāli tag. For example, “letting go” is glossed as [[Relinquishment](../../pages/tags/relinquishment.html)] (paṭinissagga), and “Arising and ceasing” is [[Impermanence](../../pages/tags/impermanence.html)] (anicca). In a more complicated example, skillful thought is glossed as [[Directed thought and evaluation](../../pages/tags/directed-thought-and-evaluation.html)] (vitakka-vicāra), for which applied and sustained thought is an alternative translation.

Sometimes separate Pāli terms appearing in the various lists are sufficiently close in meaning it does not make sense to distinguish them as separate tags. For example, Non ill-will is subsumed under [[Goodwill](../../pages/tags/goodwill.html)] (metta), and Rewards of heaven (part of the [[Gradual Teaching](../../pages/tags/gradual-teaching.html)]) is subsumed under [[Deva](../../pages/tags/deva.html)].
## Tag Choices

Although the basic structure began with the Buddha’s lists, it evolved organically to fit the audio content. In the course of this process, I had to make many somewhat arbitrary decisions, particularly regarding how to mesh Pāli and English concepts. For example, multiple Pāli terms are clearly related to [[Discernment](../../pages/tags/discernment.html)] (pañña; see “[Why is discernment a better word for wisdom?](../../pages/events/SRD2013.html#SRD2013_S01_F03)”). When tagging English discourse, when to use [[Discernment](../../pages/tags/discernment.html)] and when to use related terms? I chose the following [[Investigation of states](../../pages/tags/investigation-of-states.html)] (dhamma-vicaya) for identifying skillful and unskillful states of mind in the early stages of meditation and [[Appropriate attention](../../pages/tags/appropriate-attention.html)] (yoniso manasikāra) for acts of discernment related to the field of attention. Vīmaṃsā, one of the four [Bases of Success](../../pages/drilldown/tag-087.html#87) describes reviewing the results of past actions with a view to further improve in the future, but I chose to subsume this under the tag [[Discernment](../../pages/tags/discernment.html)].

Other somewhat arbitrary choices regarding specific tags include the following:

 - Thinking is [[Directed thought and evaluation](../../pages/tags/directed-thought-and-evaluation.html)] or [[Proliferation](../../pages/tags/proliferation.html)] depending on its skillfulness.
 - [[Proliferation](../../pages/tags/proliferation.html)] encompasses both unskillful obsessive thinking and objectification, two translations of papañca.
 - [[Suffering](../../pages/tags/suffering.html)] refers to the common experience; [[Noble Truth of Suffering](../../pages/tags/noble-truth-of-suffering.html)] applies only to reflective understanding of dukkha as part of the Path.
 - The tag scheme distinguishes [[Suffering](../../pages/tags/suffering.html)] and [[Pain](../../pages/tags/pain.html)] as two distinct meanings of the Pāli word dukkha, but pleasure and happiness (two meanings of sukha) are both tagged [[Happiness](../../pages/tags/happiness.html)].
 - Sensual pleasure and sensual desire are both tagged [[Sensual desire](../../pages/tags/sensual-desire.html)].
 - Several Thai words are frequently translated as “the one who knows.” These are tagged [[Knowing itself](../../pages/tags/knowing-itself.html)]
 - [[Moods of the mind](../../pages/tags/moods-of-the-mind.html)] refers specifically to the Thai phrase _arom kong jit_, and is distinct from the English tag [[Emotion](../../pages/tags/emotion.html)]

## History and Culture Tags

The root tags [[History](../../pages/tags/history.html)] and [[Cultural context](../../pages/tags/cultural-context.html)] contain many similar subtags. History tags apply to verifiable statements about people, dates, etc., while culture tags apply to generalized statements about culture in particular times and places. The latter are invariably subjective. The frequency of [[Culture/Thailand](../../pages/tags/culturethailand.html)] and [[Culture/West](../../pages/tags/culturewest.html)] reflects an ongoing dialogue about how to skillfully adapt (or not adapt) the practices and attitudes of the Thai Forest Tradition to the modern Western context.

## Other Details
 - Many of the teachers in the archive have tags corresponding to their names. Searching by teacher shows excerpts taught by the teacher; searching by tag shows excerpts containing biographical information about the teacher.
 - Monastic teacher tags are sorted by date of ordination regardless of gender. Lay teacher tags are sorted by date of birth.
 - The traditional three [[Characteristics of existence](../../pages/tags/characteristics-of-existence.html)] increase to nine with the inclusion of an [additional six](https://www.abhayagiri.org/media/books/The-Island-Web-2020%20ed..pdf#page=115) by Ajahn Buddhadāsa.
