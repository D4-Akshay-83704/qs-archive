## License
We will finalize copyright and licensing details in the first official release of the archive, planned for late October 2023. For the time being, all newly created material in the project is:

#### Draft license for review by collaborators – Not yet in effect
This license applies to all new material created as part of the Ajahn Pasanno Question and Story Archive. This includes all versions of the website itself, the json database files, the material on github, and all versions of the main Google sheet used to generate the database and website. It neither grants nor removes permissions regarding material used in the Archive obtained from other sources.

This is a complex project, and different portions of the APQS Archive are released under separate licenses.

Monastic Dhamma teachings are usually distributed under the CC BY-NC-ND license to prevent modification and commercial use. Most of the recordings underlying the Archive are available outside the Archive for free distribution, but splitting the recordings into excerpts removes much of the context of the teachings. It’s important to reassure teachers that their recordings and transcripts won’t be reused in harmful or undesired ways. Thus we apply the CC BY-NC-ND license to the _entire archive_ to allow distribution while preserving the context of the teaching.

However, we would like to allow others to reuse most portions of this project apart from the recordings and transcripts and so apply less restrictive licenses to the source code and tag hierarchy.

In greater detail, portions of the Archive may be distributed under three licenses. The list below names each license followed by its scope:

__1. CC BY-NC-ND__

__Scope:__ _The archive as a whole._ At a minimum, this means all files needed to display the complete website and play each audio clip. Along with these files, you may additionally include any other new material created as part of the Archive (items #2 and #3 below) and any parts of the Archive drawn from other sources (e.g. session audio recordings and pdf files of the references) that you have permission to distribute in this way. 

__2. CC BY-NC__

__Scope:__ _The hierarchical tagging scheme._ This consists of the Tags sheet in the APQS Archive main spreadsheet.

__3. An open source license. Perhaps MIT?__

__Scope:__ _The database format and website generation engine._ This includes all source code, all documentation files, and all sheets in the APQS Archive main spreadsheet except the Tags sheet and sheets containing transcribed audio recordings. It specifically excludes all audio files and any file or spreadsheet sheet which contains transcribed audio recordings.

This license applies to all versions of the Archive that have been posted on abhayagiri.org. However, we encourage anyone distributing or mirroring the Archive to keep your copy up to date.
