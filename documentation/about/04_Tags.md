# Tags
The archive uses a hierarchical scheme to organize the over 300 tags it employs. This scheme follows the structure of the Pāli teachings when possible, but I have needed to invent new categories for modern subjects. Mirroring the structure of the teachings, individual tags often appear multiple times in the hierarchy. For example, [[Equanimity](../tags/equanimity.html)] (upekkha) appears as a factor of [[Right Concentration](../tags/right-concentration.html)] and in the lists of [[Factors of Awakening](../tags/factors-of-awakening.html)], [[Divine Abidings](../tags/divine-abidings.html)], and [[Perfections](../tags/perfections.html)]. One can explore the tag hierarchy by starting with the [root tags](../drilldown/tag-999.html#-1) and successively expanding them to reveal the subtags they contain.

## Tag Structure

The superstructure of the tagging scheme can be understood by examining this grouping of the 16 root tags:

__A. Mental qualities__

1. [Skillful qualities](../drilldown/tag-000.html#0)
2. [Unskillful qualities](../drilldown/tag-172.html#172)
3. [Indeterminate qualities](../drilldown/tag-213.html#213)

 __B. Modes of practice__

4. [Three Refuges](../drilldown/tag-265.html#265)
5. [Devotional practice](../drilldown/tag-272.html#272)
6. [Precepts](../drilldown/tag-290.html#290)
7. [Meditation](../drilldown/tag-317.html#317)

 __C. Sources of Dhamma teachings__

8. [Teaching Dhamma](../drilldown/tag-389.html#389)
9. [Teachers](../drilldown/tag-425.html#425)
10. [Monasteries](../drilldown/tag-491.html#491)

 __D. Context of teaching and and practice__

11. [Nature of the cosmos](../drilldown/tag-514.html#514)
12. [History](../drilldown/tag-533.html#533)
13. [Cultural context](../drilldown/tag-543.html#543)
14. [Spiritual traditions](../drilldown/tag-560.html#560)

 __E. Domains of teaching and practice__

15. [Renunciant practice](../drilldown/tag-572.html#572)
16. [Everyday life](../drilldown/tag-639.html#639)

As in the teachings themselves, the tag structure gives first priority to understanding skillful and unskillful stages of mind. Next come strategies for cultivating skillful states of mind and details about the transmission of the teachings, followed by tags describing the context within which this all occurs.

Tags are organized chronologically and conceptually; earlier and more fundamental tags come first. For example, the subtags of [Skillful qualities](../drilldown/tag-000.html#0) begin by following the order of explanation in the [Buddha’s first teaching](https://www.abhayagiri.org/media/books/Chanting-Book-Vol-1-Web.pdf#page=110): [[Middle Path](../tags/middle-path.html)], [[Noble Eightfold Path](../tags/eightfold-path.html)], [[Four Noble Truths](../tags/four-noble-truths.html)]. This is followed by the [[Aids to Awakening](../tags/aids-to-awakening.html)], the Buddha’s own summary of his teachings comprising seven sets of skillful qualities, totalling 37 qualities in all. Next come the sets contained with the Aids to Enlightenment that are not contained within the Eightfold Path itself: [[Four Bases of Success](../tags/bases-of-success.html)], [[Five Faculties](../tags/faculties.html)], [[Seven Factors of Awakening](../tags/factors-of-awakening.html)]. Following this are two canonical and one early post-canonical list: [[Divine Abidings](../tags/divine-abidings.html)], [[Seven Treasures](../tags/treasures.html)], and [[Ten Perfections](../tags/perfections.html)].
