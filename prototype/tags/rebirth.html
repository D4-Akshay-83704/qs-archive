I am contemplating cessation and would like to hear more about the cessation of the body-death. I have been with a few beings as they have died, 1 human and a few pets. Is the manner of death important to having a “good” rebirth? Does being afraid or suffering a great deal affect the next life directly or is the experience of death just added to ones overall karma?” [<a href = "../tags/death.html">Death</a>] // [<a href = "../tags/stream-entry.html">Stream entry</a>]

Karuṇadhammo, could you say a bit more about how you find a belief in rebirth to be motivational? And that it “just makes sense?”  Do you think, perhaps, about the person who will inherit your rebirth and how it would be good to load them up with good kamma? Thanks!”  Answered by Ajahn Karuṇadhammo. [<a href = "../tags/kamma.html">Kamma</a>]

Does the Buddha speak to that which continues after the body dies? Other than the five recollections and contemplating impermanence, does he offer guidance on how to best prepare to greet ones own death? Thank you so much.” [<a href = "../tags/recollectiondeath.html">Recollection/Death</a>] [<a href = "../tags/impermanence.html">Impermanence</a>]

How do we know it? Also, I have heard that the merit from practicing meditation will accumulate and stay with ones who have practiced that, which also carries over throughout the life or the subsequent incarnations.
