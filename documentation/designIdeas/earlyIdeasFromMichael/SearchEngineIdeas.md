From an email from Michael Dec. 3, 2022:

The spreadsheet is looking good. 

Instead of trying to build something in HTML, I'd suggest just drawing a few wireframes on paper to give me a little more about your vision. Attached is a really quick wireframe (dharma_talks_explorer.png) of one idea that came to my mind when looking at the data. 

A few more details:

- I imagine an audio player that lets you search, browse, favorite, and share clips. 
- You could search or browse by speaker, event, topic (tags), keyword (searching the transcriptions), date, or popularity. 
- For topics, I'd suggest some hierarchy to the tags or tags for the tags that let you group the tags in different ways (e.g., show me all the tags about mindfulness).
