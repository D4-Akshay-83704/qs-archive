# Status – $!gOptions.info.releaseName.title()!$

## Content
This release contains $!len(gDatabase["excerpts"])!$ excerpts from $!len(gDatabase["event"])!$ events, comprising over 80 hours of audio. I typically transcribe audio by hand and later type these transcriptions into the computer. As of the initial release there are 288 transcribed pages, of which $!137 + 7 + 10!$ have been entered into the Archive. The detailed status of transcription is as follows:

### Thanksgiving Retreats
Existing transcriptions of the questions from the 2013-2016 TG retreats have been incorporated into the Archive. I have tagged these questions based on the transcriptions but haven't listened to the recordings themselves. Untranscribed audio recordings of Ajahn Pasanno question and answer sessions are available for the 2010-2012 retreats. Question and answer sessions with other Abhayagiri teachers have been recorded for four more retreats. If you would like to help transcribe and tag these retreats, see [Want to help?](about:want-to-help) for details.

### Winter Retreats
Three sessions from the [2014 Winter Retreat](event:WR2014) and half of the [2015 Winter Retreat](event:WR2015) are presently included in the Archive. The remaining sessions have been transcribed by hand and await data entry. A series of interviews and discussion with Ajahn Pasanno at the end of the 2018 Winter Retreat is included as [The Teaching and the Training](event:WR2018-2). Abhayagiri residents created retreat compilation discs of the 2013 and 2016 Winter Retreats, and audio recordings are available of several more Winter Retreats.

### Spirit Rock Daylongs
All four recordings of daylong events led by Ajahn Pasanno at Spirit Rock Meditation Center on abhayagiri.org are included in the Archive.

### Upāsikā Days
15 out of 20 Upāsikā Days led by Ajahn Pasanno with recordings on abhayagiri.org are in the Archive. The remaining five await data entry.

### Other
I have finished a handwritten transcription of the 2001 Ajahn Chah Conference. Many voices contributed to this memorable event, so it will take a while to obtain permission to include their teachings in the Archive.

## Known issues and limitations

 - Pressing the back button sometimes returns to a seemingly random scroll position on the previous page ([Github issue #52](https://github.com/Kaccana-Bhikkhu/qs-archive/issues/52)).
 - References do not link to specific pages within the pdf on mobile browsers.
