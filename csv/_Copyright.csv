Copyright

There are three distinct parts to this project:

1. The audio Q&A database format and the website engines that turn it into html code

2. The tagging scheme partially based on lists from the Pāli Canon

3. The recorded audio and its transcriptions within in the database and websites

"I need to confer with my collaborators and fellow monastics, but I hope to license #1 and #2 such that they can be openly modified and reused, perhaps using something like the GPL.
However, monastic Dhamma teachings usually use the CC BY-NC-ND license to prevent modification and commercial use.
#3 falls in this category, and it’s important to reassure teachers that their recordings and question transcripts won’t be reused in harmful or undesired ways."

"Most Abhayagiri publications are © Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery.
This seems the most suitable organisation to assign the copyright to #3, but I haven’t asked Abhayagiri yet.
I would like to consult with people more knowledgeable than I before deciding on license and copyright matters.
Thus for the time being, all newly created material in the project is:"
