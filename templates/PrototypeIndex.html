<body lang="en-GB" dir="ltr"><h2 class="western">Introduction</h2>
<p>Ajahn Pasanno excels at answering Dhamma questions. I estimate
there are perhaps 100 hours of his question and answer sessions
posted online. If you have a Dhamma question, it&rsquo;s likely that
Ajahn Pasanno has spoken to it in the past. But how will you find his
answer amidst the hours of available recordings?</p>
<p>This is a demonstration prototype of a search engine to answer
this question. The database contains transcriptions/summaries of the
questions asked and links to Ajahn Pasanno&rsquo;s recorded answers.
Each question is tagged by subject and organised according to the
event it occurred in. The web design is ancient (hopefully you aren&rsquo;t
using a mobile device!), but it&rsquo;s enough to demonstrate the
principle and debug the database.</p>
<p>The principles described below are my best thinking so far. They
are open to revision if Ajahn Pasanno, Ajahn &Ntilde;&#257;&#7751;iko,
or the Abhayagiri Sa&#7749;gha object.</p>
<h2 class="western">Collaborators</h2>
<p>I created this demonstration prototype, but my web design skills
go no further. My nephew Owen Leggett (almost 13!) volunteered to
design a modern website using the same questions database as the
prototype. Owen&rsquo;s father, Michael Leggett, who once worked on
the Gmail design team, has already provided valuable advice to both
of us. I have done all the tagging so far, but I intend to invite
online volunteers to help with transcription and tagging later on.</p>
<h2 class="western">Scope</h2>
<p>Initially the project will focus on Q&amp;A sessions with Ajahn
Pasanno, although we will transcribe questions incidentally answered
by other teachers in these Q&amp;A sessions. If there is energy and
interest, we might expand the scope to include questions and answers
from other Abhayagiri teachers or non-Abhayagiri teachers at
Abhayagiri-sponsored events. In this case, it would become the
Abhayagiri Q&amp;A Archive. However this is as far as the project
will go. We will source audio recordings only from abhayagiri.org and
Abhayagiri&rsquo;s YouTube channel. Perhaps others might create a
website to index Q&amp;A sessions from other teachers (see Copyright
below). An <a href="http://www.boenn.org/ajahn_sona/faq2.php">index
of Ajahn Sona YouTube Q&amp;A sessions</a> already exists.</p>
<h2 class="western">Teacher consent</h2>
<p>Not all monks and nuns want their teachings widely distributed. A
properly-implemented <a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/economy.html">monastic
economy of gifts</a> ensures that material support for monastics is
independent of teaching activity, and the concern is more that people
receive skillful answers to their questions than that they listen to
<i>our</i> answers. At the same time, a diversity of voices answering
a question can help the listener understand multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we will ask teachers individually about their
detailed preferences before including their questions in the archive.
If teachers prefer, they can review each question individually before
deciding whether it should be included in the archive. It&rsquo;s too
much to ask volunteers to keep track of whether or not they should
transcribe a question based all these factors, so the database keeps
track of which teachers have given their consent for what. The
website generation engine excludes questions accordingly before they
become available online.</p>
<p>This part of the software is already functional. As of now, the
prototype archive excludes two questions answered by teachers other
than Ajahn Pasanno because I haven&rsquo;t yet asked their
preferences.</p>
<h2 class="western">Copyright</h2>
<p>There are three distinct parts to this project:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>The audio Q&amp;A database format and the website engines
	that turn it into html code</p>
	<li><p>The tagging scheme partially based on lists from the P&#257;li
	Canon</p>
	<li><p>The recorded audio and its transcriptions within in the
	database and websites</p>
</ol>
<p>I need to confer with my collaborators and fellow monastics, but I
hope to license #1 and #2 such that they can be openly modified and
reused, perhaps using a version of the GPL. However, monastic Dhamma
teachings usually use the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC
BY-NC-ND</a> license to prevent modification and commercial use. #3
falls in this category, and it&rsquo;s important to reassure teachers
that their recordings and question transcripts won&rsquo;t be reused
in harmful or undesired ways.</p>
<p>Most Abhayagiri publications are &copy; Abhayagiri Buddhist
Monastery. This seems the most suitable organisation to assign the
copyright to #3, but I haven&rsquo;t asked Abhayagiri yet.</p>
<p>I would like to consult with people more knowledgeable than I
before deciding on license and copyright matters. Thus for the time
being, whatever newly created material there is in the project is</p>
