There are three distinct parts to this project:

1. The audio Q&A database format and the website engines that turn it into html code
2. The tagging scheme partially based on lists from the Pāli Canon
3. The recorded audio and its transcriptions within in the database and websites

I need to confer with my collaborators and fellow monastics, but I hope to license #1 and #2 such that they can be openly modified and reused, perhaps using something like the GPL. However, monastic Dhamma teachings usually use the CC BY-NC-ND license to prevent modification and commercial use. #3 falls in this category, and it’s important to reassure teachers that their recordings and question transcripts won’t be reused in harmful or undesired ways.

We will finalize copyright and licensing details in the first official release of the archive. For the time being, all newly created material in the project is:
