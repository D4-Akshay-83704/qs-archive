<!--TITLE:Version list-->
<h1>Version list</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1.0: First publicly available prototype; contains all questions from Thanksgiving Retreats 2013-2015 from pre-existing transcriptions; subject tags are based on transcription text rather than audio content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1.9: Index stories, quotes, and readings in addition to questions. Added Spirit Rock daylong events from 2010 and 2011. The tag list has expanded to include tags from many events transcribed on paper that have not yet been entered into the online archive. Almost all documentation still applies to version 1.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1.91: Added events: DRBU Q&amp;A, The Teaching and the Training, and Living in a Changing Society. Remove unused tags from the tag list (possibly still a few glitches).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1.92: Added Teen Weekend 2017. Added teacher pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1.93: Added Tea Time Q&amp;A and Abhayagiri Kaṭhina 2021. Embed audio players in the page for each excerpt. This allows one to read transcriptions while listening to the talk, but clutters the visual interface. The Abhayagiri 20th Anniversary page demonstrates a good solution, but it’s well beyond my web skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.0 (May 15, 2023): All pages look much better thanks to css code contributed by Chris Claudius.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.1 Added three Upasika Days: Thai Forest Tradition, Mindfulness of Breathing, and Jhāna: A Practical Approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.1.1 Added three Upasika Days: Honoring the Buddha, The Middle Way of Not-self, and Death and Dying. Added the Spirit Rock Daylong about Friendship.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>2.1.3 Added Upasika Day: Right Livelihood.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>3.0 Floating media player (Thanks Owen!). Drill-down tag hierarchy. Category subsearch on All Excerpts and tag pages. About pages are rendered from markdown files in documentation/about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3.1 Alphabetical tag listings. List events by series and year. List teachers chronologically and by lineage. Category search on teacher pages. Links between teacher and tag pages. Calming the Busy Mind Upasika Day.</p>
</li>
