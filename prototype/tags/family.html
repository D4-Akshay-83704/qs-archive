  <b>Quote:</b>  “I dedicate my body and mind, my whole life, to the practice of the Lord Buddha’s teachings in their entirety. I will realize the truth in this lifetime … I will let go of everything and follow the teachings. No matter how much suffering and difficulty I have to endure I will persevere, otherwise there will be no end to my doubts. I will make this life as even and continuous as a single day and night. I will abandon attachments to mind and body and follow the Buddha’s teachings until I know their truth for myself.” — Ajahn Chah [<a href = "../tags/ardency.html">Ardency</a>] [<a href = "../tags/patience.html">Patience</a>] [<a href = "../tags/doubt.html">Doubt</a>] [<a href = "../tags/continuity-of-mindfulness.html">Continuity of mindfulness</a>] [<a href = "../tags/relinquishment.html">Relinquishment</a>] [<a href = "../tags/knowledge-and-vision.html">Knowledge and vision</a>]
