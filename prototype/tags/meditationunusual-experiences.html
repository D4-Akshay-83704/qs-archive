  <b>Quote:</b>  “It isn't so much the experience of extreme well-being that is the goal. It's the ability to gain clarity and stability so that one can see through the experience as something that is uncertain or impermanent, has a changing nature. The mind often wants to disregard that. The tendency to identify self with experience on a refined mental level is tempered by the body experience.”  — <A href = ../teachers/ajahn-pasanno.html>Ajahn Pasanno</a> [<a href = "../tags/clear-comprehension.html">Clear comprehension</a>] [<a href = "../tags/concentration.html">Concentration</a>] [<a href = "../tags/knowledge-and-vision.html">Knowledge and vision</a>] [<a href = "../tags/impermanence.html">Impermanence</a>] [<a href = "../tags/delusion.html">Delusion</a>] [<a href = "../tags/self-identity-view.html">Self-identity view</a>] [<a href = "../tags/relinquishment.html">Relinquishment</a>]

This has occurred on retreat for 30 years. At first, I assumed it was the usual resistances / saṅkhāras. For a decade, I’ve known it’s a neurological syndrome that many have (R.L.S.) and although it affects other parts of life, e.g., sleep, it’s never so intense as on retreat in the evening. As I calm and cleanse, it actually gets worse, even on longer retreats. If I don’t focus on exhaling calm and mettā, I would drive my neighbors crazy, twitching and squirming like a bored 4 year-old. But I’m not bored and I want to hear the teachings. The level of controlling the legs necessarily, even with calming, creates sometimes a kind of negative pīti—thunderbolts in the body with no delight or rapture! I intuit an ancient root to it but, what to do? Alternative and western guidance have not helped much. From your vast experience of squirming mediators, any advice? Any research on sitting and milder neurological phenomena like this? Right now, besides leaving the hall / tortured endurance / drugs / cutting off my legs, suggestions for a middle way?!”  <b>[<a href = "../tags/meditationunusual-experiences.html">Meditation/Unusual experiences</a>]</b> [<a href = "../tags/rapture.html">Rapture</a>] [<a href = "../tags/restlessness-and-worry.html">Restlessness and worry</a>]
