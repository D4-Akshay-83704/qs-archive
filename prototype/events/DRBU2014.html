<p style="font-size: 120%;">
  A small group from the Dharma Realm Buddhist University (DRBU) located at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas (CTTB) spent the morning at Abhayagiri. The group included two bhikkshunis as well as a number of resident volunteers at the CTTB. The students are in DRBUâ€™s Masters of Arts in Buddhist Classics program. This semester the students have been reading various spiritual biographies including the biographies of the Thai Forest masters Ajahn Mun, Ajahn Tate and Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo. The audio is from their question and answer session with Ajahn Pasanno.
