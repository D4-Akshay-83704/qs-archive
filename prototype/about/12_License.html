<p>There are three distinct parts to this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>The audio Q&amp;A database format and the website engines that turn it into html code</li>
<li>The tagging scheme partially based on lists from the Pāli Canon</li>
<li>The recorded audio and its transcriptions within in the database and websites</li>
</ol>
<p>I need to confer with my collaborators and fellow monastics, but I hope to license #1 and #2 such that they can be openly modified and reused, perhaps using something like the GPL. However, monastic Dhamma teachings usually use the CC BY-NC-ND license to prevent modification and commercial use. #3 falls in this category, and it’s important to reassure teachers that their recordings and question transcripts won’t be reused in harmful or undesired ways.</p>
<p>We will finalize copyright and licensing details in the first official release of the archive. For the time being, all newly created material in the project is:</p>
