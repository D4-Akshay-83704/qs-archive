# Tags
The archive uses a hierarchical scheme to organize the over 300 tags it employs. This scheme follows the structure of the PƒÅli teachings when possible, but I have needed to invent new categories for modern subjects. Mirroring the structure of the teachings, individual tags often appear multiple times in the hierarchy. For example, [Equanimity](../tags/equanimity.html) (upekkha) appears as a factor of [Right Concentration](../tags/right-concentration.html) and in the lists of [Factors of Awakening](../tags/factors-of-awakening.html), [Divine Abidings](../tags/divine-abidings.html), and [Perfections](../tags/perfections.html). One can explore the tag hierarchy by starting with the root tags and successively expanding them to reveal the subtags they contain.

## Tag Structure

The superstructure of the tagging scheme can be understood by examining this grouping of the 16 root tags:

__A. Mental qualities__

1. [Skillful qualities](../tags/skillful-qualities.html)
2. [Unskillful qualities](../tags/unskillful-qualities.html)
3. Indeterminate qualities

4. [Three Refuges](../tags/three-refuges.html)

6. [Precepts](../tags/precepts.html)
7. [Meditation](../tags/meditation.html)

 __C. Sources of Dhamma teachings__

8. [Teaching Dhamma](../tags/teaching-dhamma.html)
