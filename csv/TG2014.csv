1,0:19,,AP,"In what cases, if any, is it useful to try to assess whether stream entry has occurred? Or is this question best left aside?",Stream entry,,,,,,
1,5:17,,AP,"How should I repay your kindness, the immense kindness of the Buddha?",Gratitude,,,,,,
1,8:21,,AP,Is walking meditation as “good” as sitting meditation. Can one achieve the level of undistractedness that one needs to be able to investigate the human experience? Or is it part of the bigger picture of mindfulness / or seven full days to experience stream entry?,Posture/Walking,,,,,,
1,17:16,,AP,"Thank you for your talk on mindfulness today—very helpful. I've been practicing for a long time (and have even had a few insights that made big impressions on me) and while my sila has definitely improved, my mindfulness is a priority and I might have a tad more wisdom, my mind looks for ways to suffer. Sometimes I feel like a total failure as a Buddhist. I understand that letting go of identity view is the answer, but how? What am I missing?",Long-term practice,,,,,,
1,22:44,,AP,"In your ānāpānasati talks, you talk about sikkhita, defined as…to train, and to learn from. I'm not sure how active to be because when I train, I have a goal in mind, but when I learn from…I'm more relaxed and open to what is revealed. Similar, today with mindfulness defined as…looking after something, I'm not sure how to point the compass without coming from self view. Thank you.",Right mindfulness,,,,,,
1,29:26,,AP,"It appears that walking is far more comfortable than sitting these days, but I have never found it to be that settling for my mind. Please offer some advice on how to get “the most” out of walking meditation.",Posture/Walking,,,,,,
1,36:36,,AP,In the context of deep love—like between spouses or between parent and child—what is the application of the concept of non-attachment? What does it mean?,Family,Relinquishment,,,,,
1,39:46,,AP,"A scientist—popular, interesting—said as parting shot to his audience, “don't trust the senses,” i.e., we'd still think the world flat, and that the sun actually rises and sets, if we trusted the sensory world. Your thoughts on clear comprehension via “sense-doors?” The “just-rightness” of it all. I wonder if we still thought the world flat and the sun to rise whether we might care for it.",Six sense bases,,,,,,
1,44:13,,AP,How does one work with the vedanā and neutral sensations?,Mindfulness of feeling,,,,,,
1,50:37,,AP,"If unwholesome thoughts arise and it creates fear and a repeating pattern, what is the best method for breaking the patterns? For instance, mettā meditation replacing the fear or attention with something else? Thank for the inspiration.",Fear,Goodwill,,,,,
2,0:12,,AP,"On “The Discourse on Setting in Motion the Wheel of The Dhamma,” toward the end it says, “my knowledge and vision of reality of regarding the Four Noble Truths, in their three phases and twelve aspects.” What are the “three phases and twelve aspects?” Thanks for your teachings.",Four Noble Truths,,,,,,
2,2:29,,AP,"In the chant on “The Buddha's Words on Loving Kindness,” what does the line that says “unburdened with duties” mean? Does it mean that we are to not have duties, or that we do not feel burdened by them, or does it mean something else? Thank you!",Work,,,,,,
2,7:11,,AP,"This has happened a few times only but I'm puzzled, please help. When my mind was very calm, a sudden sort of energetic feeling is all over the body and my spine feels very cold. And then suddenly I have a flash of memory from childhood of drowning in the tank in our backyard. On a different occasion I saw the dead putrefied face of an old woman, horrific, mouth wide open. How do I deal with all this? I get a shock and concentration stops, sometimes sending shivers.",Meditation/Unusual experiences,,,,,,

2,18:38,,AP,You mentioned that asubha practice can cool sensual desire. But what if what you are attracted to is not so much a physical thing but an attraction of the heart—of good qualities you see. What cools the heart if you are hooked?,Unattractiveness,Dispassion,,,,,

2,32:16,,AP,"Thank you for so many wonderful teachings. I am contemplating cessation and would like to hear more about the cessation of the body-death. I have been with a few beings as they have died, 1 human and a few pets. Is the manner of death important to having a “good” rebirth? Does being afraid or suffering a great deal affect the next life directly or is the experience of death just added to ones overall karma?",Death,Rebirth,,,Stream entry,,Yes
2,38:01,,AP,Is it possible to post a list of the focuses of the 16 steps? It would be a helpful resource for the remainder of the retreat.,,,,,,,Yes
2,38:36,,AP,Its been years since I needed to do so much laying down meditation. My back is not cooperating this retreat. Can you refresh my memory on tricks to not fall asleep? Eyes open feels as if I struggle to maintain it.,Posture/Lying down,,,,,,

2,48:27,,AP,"Regarding the 1st precept of non-killing / non-harming, what to do on a practical / decision level regarding something like termites? I sold my last house because I didn't want to fumigate, but I can't keep moving to avoid killing termites / ants that eat at a house. Thank you for your compassion and explanation.",Killing,,,,,,
2,54:49,,AP,"The problem of extremes. Yesterday, pīti. This morning, the horrors of the bait and craving for annihilation in all their ugliness. Then, pīti again. The only thing I've figured is to back off from meditation when things get too extreme. Any other suggestions?",Meditation/General advice,,,,,,
3,0:13,,AP,"During my meditation, I can occasionally calm the mind to the point where it seems devoid of thought. It is temporary, like a door opening. How should I use this opportunity? Concentrate on the breath? Wait for thoughts to arise and watch them? Explore / investigate a topic that is causing my suffering? Other? With gratitude.",Tranquility,Meditation/General advice,,,,,
3,5:11,,AP,"With all of many excellent frames of reference the Buddha has given us to understand our experience, it can be confusing to know which to use when! Do you recommend training systematically or letting ones intuition be as their guide? Thank you.",Right mindfulness,,,,,,
3,6:19,,AP,"Can you please speak a little more about the process of bringing in a wholesome, brightening reflection into meditation? This morning you spoke about using directed thought / evaluation to explore the primary object (breath) then bringing in the “brightening” object. In this way, the attention shifts back and forth from breath to “brightening” object? Should one use this reflection often? Always? Please speak about this process. Thank you.",Directed thought and evaluation,Gladdening the mind,,,,,
3,12:05,,AP,"I've enjoyed practicing with connecting the breath to whatever is conditioning the mind. Twice however, when evaluating, I've come across something new: a plain, white, fizzy, barrier. It's not un-friendly and I can feel a faint tug from whatever is behind it but that's as far as I get. Have my saṅkhāra’s developed a new stealth technology? Are they allowed to do that? Any advice on how to proceed (or secret passwords)? Gratefully appreciated.",Mindfulness of breathing,Meditation/Unusual experiences,,,,,
3,15:09,,AP,"As I understand it, it is rare and fortunate to have a human birth because of the amount of suffering in the human realm that may lead one to practice to end suffering. On the other hand, devas have less suffering. Therefore they would be less motivated to practice to end suffering, correct? If so, would it not be better for one to wish oneself and others to be reborn in the human realm if one aspires full liberation?",Humans,Devas,,,,,
3,18:07,,AP,"When you described pīti yesterday, it was different than how I think of it. Sometimes, I get a feeling of a great, expansive happiness like the realization that this practice actually works. It's exciting and empowering but I'm not jumping up and down. It's a combination of the mind settling and opening. Is that a cousin of pīti? Does pīti only happen in meditation?",Rapture and pleasure,,,,,,
3,20:34,,AP,"Thank you for these wonderful teachings. I understand that “citta” is both the heart and mind but my felt experience is often so different. My mind is often crabby and critical and down right mean, at least to me, but my heart is soft and sweet and easily moved. In fact, my mind can make my heart cry! Please help with this dilemma. Much mettā.",Nature of mind,,,,,,
3,22:25,,AP,"I know parting with loved ones is a natural course of life, but deep sadness and grief arises when I reflect on that. Could you instruct on how to work with this grief? Is there a level of understanding when there is no grief? Thank you!",Grief,,,,,,
3,31:39,,AP,"1. What is meant by “releasing” the mind? Releasing it from any hindrance? Can you place illustrate with examples? 2. How is “calming mental fabrication” different from “releasing the mind?” Any examples to illustrate? 3. When mental fabrication causes a bodily or verbal fabrication such as in anxiety or sensual desire, it it too late to breathe and calm fabrications?",Mindfulness of breathing,Tranquility,Volitional formations,,,,
3,39:11,,AP,How do you use mindfulness of breathing when are doing a recollection? Do you first use mindfulness of breathing to settle the mind / body and then turn your attention to the recollection? Is the awareness of breathing in the background?,Mindfulness of breathing,Recollection,,,,,
3,43:20,,AP,Should I focus on one object of mindfulness at a time or can I be mindful of all 4 at one time? Thank you!,Right mindfulness,,,,,,
3,45:16,,AP,You mentioned “inner confidence…” can you describe it in more detail and the ways to cultivate it? Respectfully.,Jhāna,,,,,,
3,50:59,,AKd,"Dear Aj. Karuṇadhammo, could you say a bit more about how you find a belief in rebirth to be motivational? And that it “just makes sense?”  Do you think, perhaps, about the person who will inherit your rebirth and how it would be good to load them up with good kamma? Thanks!",Rebirth,Kamma,,,,,
3,56:15,,AP,"Could you please speak a bit about karma and volition? For instance, if an unwholesome thought such as anger, or fear arises or wants to arise of its own accord in the mind, does one get unwholesome karma? Or is the bad karma produced only through the grasping or rejection of it? Or is bad karma produced only if action is taken? Or are different kinds of karma produced for thought vs. action?",Kamma,Volition,,,,,
3,63:05,,AP,Please talk about 1) whole-body breathing 2) choice-less awareness. Thank you Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn  Karuṇadhammo for wonderfully helpful talks.,Mindfulness of breathing,Relinquishment,,,,,

3,74:16,,AP,"I have enjoyed the mindfulness instruction and Dhamma talks very much. When talking about the main subject in English, could you also please use the equivalent word in Pali? For words such as “the Four Noble Truths,” “hindrances,” and “the Four Foundations of Mindfulness,” etc.",,,,,,,
4,0:03,,AP,"How refined should the practice of being sensitive to the entire body be? Say, should I be able to sense my earlobe or liver? I find it hard to sense the body when it gets calm. Is it normal or is it a lack of discernment?",Mindfulness of body,,,,,,
4,2:03,,AP,It's my first time listen to Ajahn Ñāniko. What have you done to him Luang Por?,,,,,,,
4,2:31,,AP,Would you say more about the meaning of merit? Are there other words or definitions in English? Thanks again for your teachings.,Merit,,,,,,
4,5:22,,AP,"I find the mind especially distractable during meal times. Partly this reflects longstanding habits of talking, reading, listening to news, etc, while eating. In the retreat context, it's also due to the heightened “social” aspect of meal time (even though in silence). Can you give some suggestions for staying more present and mindful while eating? A deep bow of gratitude for your wonderful teachings…",Food,,,,,,
4,10:28,,AP,"A Buddhist teacher explains as I understand it, that the first three factors of enlightenment are causes and the last four are the effects.

4,15:03,,AP,ขอโอกาสกร้าบพระเดชพระคุณหลวงพ่อ ถาม คําถาม Q: Stream enterer คืออะไร? การมุ่สู่โสดาปัตติผล? หรือการมุ่งสู่นิพพาน?

4,19:51,,AP,"Regarding yesterdays teaching that rebirth is happening every moment, could you give instructions on how to discern the preceding step, becoming (bhavanga)? Would you consider transition from sleep into an awakened state being as “rebirth” and whether there is becoming manifesting upon waking up?",Rebirth,Becoming,,,,,
4,22:16,,AP,Do the monks at Wat Pah Pong chant “Chinnabunchon?” Would you show how to chant it?,Wat Pah Pong,Chanting,,,,,
4,26:09,,AP,"I have an autoimmune disorder of undiagnosed origin. I was wondering if it was worth this precious time of practice to send mettā and thoughts of healing to the body. If so, how do you recommend approaching it? Also, is this compatible with seeing this ailment as a heavenly messenger (and as a contemplation of the body's demise)? As symptom management reduces it to a mild physical irritation should I also contemplate unpleasant feelings? Or is it best to just stay grounded in the breath and mettā and not risk proliferation. Much gratitude.",Sickness,Mindfulness of feeling,,,,,
4,30:40,,AP,"Thank you so much Luang Por for reminding us that chanting is also listening, paying attention, and being mindful. I noticed that when we were chanting at a fast pace, several people wouldn't be able to follow. Many of us are not familiar with Pali or Pali translated into English (combined with low light and small print). Some of us might just need a little more time. So thank you.",Chanting,,,,,,

4,36:35,,AP,What is the English translation of the meal time blessing? Thank you.,Gratitude,Chanting,,,,,
4,39:09,,AP,"The last two 3:30pm sittings have been challenging. Restless body and proliferating mind. I guess it's my time of day for anxiety. I use several techniques—mettā, 32 body parts, watch my long breaths—and by the time the bell rings, my internal landscape has changed. Thank you all for your teachings. Now, my question. I am still very attached to my husband and children. I don't want to relinquish the intimacy I share with my husband. I will suffer when they are gone. How do I reconcile this practice of relinquishment with the reality that I am a wife, mother and householder? With love.",Family,Relinquishment,,,,,
4,45:25,,AP,My relationship with my kids can be so contentious and draining—so different than I thought it would be. How can I love and train them even though it seems they were born to resist these things?,Family,,,,,,
4,47:56,,AP,"Although in reasonable condition, I am realizing that fear / anxiety of death / non-becoming is pervasive in the background of my daily life. Does the Buddha speak to that which continues after the body dies? Other than the five recollections and contemplating impermanence, does he offer guidance on how to best prepare to greet ones own death? Thank you so much.",Recollection/Death,Rebirth,Impermanence,,,,
4,57:30,,AP,Can you please talk a bit about samatha meditation and its uses for calming a very agitated or restless mind and how one might go about finding a “disk of earth” or an object of suitable color?

4,61:33,,AP,I am wondering if Buddha spoke about what part of us reincarnates. Is it possible to remember our past lives? Thank you.,Rebirth,Psychic powers,,,,,
4,65:48,,AP,"The other day when I was meditating, my heart started beating very fast. Then I got really cold and my body started shivering. I started breathing very deep to calm the body down but still couldn't control the shaking. At times like this, is it better to stop and take care of the body or keep meditating through it? Thank you.",Meditation/Unusual experiences,,,,,,
4,67:40,,AP,"Can you provide a reference as to where this printed version of the 16 stages of ānāpānasati comes from? Author, publication?",,,,,,,
4,68:20,,AP,The delusional gravity of the mind has grown stronger as I have aged. I can space out now like never before! Do you have suggestions for cutting through this spacey delusion?,Delusion,,,,,,
5,0:15,,AP,"How do I use the teaching today about investigating the cause of suffering when working with betrayal? Been married to high school sweetheart for 40 years. Raised children together and best of friends. Lately he has gone off the deep end. Midlife crisis? - who knows, but he started drinking and acting out sexually. The feelings of shock, betrayal, hurt, anger and fear are beyond words. If new relationship I would leave, but he has been in my life since I was a child. Impossible to accept but hard to leave. How do I find the cause of suffering (noble truth) you spoke of today? And how to bring some equanimity and space around this?",Family,Sexual misconduct,,,,,
5,8:50,,AP,How does a “stream enterer” know in their next life that she/he is a stream enterer?,Stream entry,,,,,,
5,10:52,,AP,"Can you talk about the quality of disgust, and how it is beneficial for practice? For example, awareness of the disgusting nature of eating and the digestive process arises when I'm eating. In all honesty, I try to finish my food as quickly as possible when this happens. Unpleasant. Is there a better / more skillful way to hold this experience?",Disenchantment,Food,,,,,
5,24:15,,AP,"I just wanted to share my gratitude for Ajahn Karuṇadhammo, Ajahn Ñāniko, and Debbie (you to Luang Por) for giving each day, very needed and timely encouragements—sometimes immediately answering a question I had just posed to myself. It's like you are all just reading my mind / heart. Questions go deeper and so do your reflections on Dhamma. (Bow, bow, bow, añjali.)",Gratitude,,,,,,
5,25:51,,AP,"There is a borderline between being fierce (in a wholesome way) and being aggressive.  I can't say anything about Dhamma teachers as I have never experienced Thai Ajahns, but a few yoga teachers I've studied with in my opinion were rather just exercising their power over students. How to tell the difference between a teacher who genuinely means well to their students while acting fierce-fully from someone on a power trip?",Teaching Dhamma,,,,,,
5,34:00,,AP,"It seems that suffering in the lives of many people, my own included, comes from feeling unworthy or unlovable. Would you have any thoughts on why so many people feel that way and what will help to let go of this feeling? Thank you!",Guilt/shame/inadequacy,,,,,,
5,39:33,,AP,It was such a joy to hear Khun Debbie give a Dhamma talk at the retreat along with the monastics. She is a jewel. Actually you all are…(triple gem). Thank you.,Gratitude,,,,,,
5,40:03,,AP,"Perception can be very slippery. I experience it as a veil, view, filter, or lens that colors a situation. The traditional Buddhist teaching of, “tinted glasses” and “bowls of water,” is very helpful. However, identification is strong. Do you have suggestions for how to see through perception? How to know when it is coloring my world view?",Perception,,,,,,
5,43:52,,AP,What is the difference between directed thought and verbal fabrication? Thank you for showing us patience.,Directed thought and evaluation,,,,,,
5,46:55,,AP,"Thank you so very much for your very compassionate, clear, and useful teachings.

We appreciate you and the rest of the Sangha!",Dependent origination,,,,,,
5,52:10,,AP,"How can one investigate without getting the mind too active? I find that when I try to investigate or reflect, my mind gets so active that I find myself getting caught up in it. Thank you.",Investigation of states,,,,,,
5,55:03,,AP,Are the teachings being recorded? What happened to the usual football game? Do you know?,,,,,,,
5,55:45,,AP,"This is a comment to say thank you to the whole Sangha, really, for your interest in practice. We were doing walking meditation and there was such a contrast between the cars driving through and the walking practice. Usually, I feel more alone in practice. It feels so good not to be the odd one out. You guys almost made me cry with sweeping the walking paths yesterday. Thank you Sangha.",Gratitude,,,,,,
5,56:47,,AP,I once heard a Tibetan teacher say “the Dharma is one.” Can the Dhamma mean phenomena in general or am I just misunderstanding?,Mindfulness of dhammas,,,,,,
5,57:55,,AP,"My body does not physically handle sitting or stationary positions for long periods of time. I would like to do more walking meditation. Walking has a lot more distractions. Can you give some specifics on where to put my focus? Rise and fall of breath, feet, skeleton moving? Where to look, etc. Is it possible to achieve the same level of calmness, concentration and insights when the body is moving and you cannot close the eyes or keep focus on one spot?",Posture/Walking,,,,,,
5,63:57,,AP,"Was the fire sermon a “teaching moment” of hyperbole? I love to take photographs, for example, and it helps me engage much more deeply with the world outside my skull. And it fills me with rapture, compassion, and joy! Does the Buddha's recipe for liberation truly entail cutting off this experience of beauty? Where's the Theravada equivalent to the Zen “suchness” —the awe of life and its ephemerality? Thank you!",Dispassion,Impermanence,Suchness,,,,
5,71:40,,AP,"I've wondered for some time how to put together (a) birth, aging, death or dukkha and (b) the cause of dukkha as craving. Is it correct to say that the source of dukkha is in the mind (i.e., craving)? If so, what does it mean to say that birth, aging, and death—facts that we don't control and can't change—are dukkha? Thank you for your generosity and wisdom.",Cause of suffering,,,,,,
5,74:24,,AP,"I was very fortunate to receive a Pali name from the Sangha. At first, I was very energized in my practice but then I saw it as just another identity to work with, particularly from a pride and self-view side. I seldom use my Pali name these days but I realize that I am neglecting this gift. How do I use my Pali name skillfully in my practice?",Self-identity view,,,,,,
5,80:06,,AP,"Was Pali ever a conversational language? Do you know of a translation of suttas that use more common, everyday words? For example, saying…letting go or releasing instead of relinquishing. I like to use simple words in the day to remind myself.",History/Early Buddhism,,,,,,
6,0:15,,AP,"A question regarding the 5 precepts. In daily life, I am really good about keeping #1, 2, 3 and 5; but somehow I found that the precept #4 is really hard. I find myself lying everyday such as: “Do I look good?” → Yes, of course. “Do you want to eat some more?” → No, thanks, I’m full (but in fact the food didn’t taste good). Or speaking at a wrong time, speaking too long, toos hort, too harsh or speaking with a wrong tone of voice. This is the hardest one for me. Kindly advise. Thank you.",Five precepts,False speech,Right speech,,,,
6,3:12,,AP,What is left once there is no self? Is it the same as enlightenment? Can a person still function in a daily life (drive a car for example)?,Not-self,Stages of awakening,,,,,
6,8:05,,AP,Thank you for bringing much needed yoga to the retreat and many thanks to Corina for her wonderful classes and her selfless service!,Gratitude,,,,,,
6,8:28,,AP,How and when did Buddhism come to Thailand?,,,,,,,
6,11:43,,AP,"Can you define / explain saṅkhāras—mental formations? For example, what phenomena does it include? How can one evaluate what is or is not a saṅkhāra? How does it differ from the hindi / yogic samskara? Thank you.",History/Thai Buddhism,,,,,,
6,16:27,,AP,"I’m wondering why the chanting says, “for me there is no other refuge, the Buddha is my excellent refuge,” and the same for the Dhamma and the Sangha when all three are refuges. Also, why are the Dhamma and the Sangha referred to as “Lord?” Thank you.",Triple Gem,,,,,,
6,19:06,,AP,I’ve recently been blessed with two local Dhamma teachers separately teaching on the hindrances. Both suggested noticing when the hindrances are not present. That’s been a hard concept to recognize. Today’s teachings on looking at the opposite of a hindrance when it is present allowed me to become consciously aware and look at “why is the opposite not present in this moment” and “what I need to release the hindrance?” I guess I’m a right-brain person.

6,28:21,,AP,"I have heard that based on the pleasure of jhāna, it is possible to overcome sexual desires more skillfully. But to have sammā samādhi one needs pāmojja. My heart has to battle sexual desire almost everyday and it is no less than painful to keep fighting the same battles.

6,34:58,,AP,My heart really wanted to serve you and the rest of the Sangha food today (of all days—Thanksgiving) out of gratitude and also because I thought that food had to be directly placed in the alms bowl of a monk in order for it to be consumed.

6,54:03,,AP,"If the body is a sack of grains, my legs after 7 / 7:30pm are electric jumping beans. This has occurred on retreat for 30 years. At first, I assumed it was the usual resistances / saṅkhāras. For a decade, I’ve known it’s a neurological syndrome that many have (R.L.S.) and although it affects other parts of life, e.g., sleep, it’s never so intense as on retreat in the evening. As I calm and cleanse, it actually gets worse, even on longer retreats. If I don’t focus on exhaling calm and mettā, I would drive my neighbors crazy, twitching and squirming like a bored 4 year-old. But I’m not bored and I want to hear the teachings. The level of controlling the legs necessarily, even with calming, creates sometimes a kind of negative pīti—thunderbolts in the body with no delight or rapture! I intuit an ancient root to it but, what to do? Alternative and western guidance have not helped much. From your vast experience of squirming mediators, any advice? Any research on sitting and milder neurological phenomena like this? Right now, besides leaving the hall / tortured endurance / drugs / cutting off my legs, suggestions for a middle way?!",Meditation/Unusual experiences,,,,,,

7,3:56,,AP,"I love clues that help identify that some experience is or is not what I thought it is. For example, Ajahn Ñāniko’s point that just a blank purely absorbed state is not jhāna, (a wrong conclusion anybody any get to) and that instead it should be more “broad-based” and mettā-bhāvanā is very useful for that. This sort of “TEST” for the labels we may jump to apply to our experience is very useful insight—“cool” if I may say. Are there more such “tests?” P.S. This is to help prevent my mind from becoming too proud, or thinking I have attained some state when not.",Jhāna,,,,,,
7,8:23,,AP,"Thank you for talking about the nun who got enlightened the other day. Also thanks to Debbie for her talk! As a female myself, I find it inspirational hearing stories about women on the path. Most teachers, well-known disciples, the Buddha himself, were males, so at times I struggled to connect to the teachings. It felt too mind-focuses, too “male” (as more women in my view connect through the heart, or at least I do). I see a lot of heart and compassion in the Dhamma now and I am learning more about women in Buddhism. It would be great to hear more stories about them in Dhamma talks and perhaps one day even have a guest nun visit and give a talk. Thank you.",Women in Buddhism,,,,,,

Who particularly inspires you? Who is worthy of respect? For example, your support of Julia Butterfly Hill was inspired by her courage and heart, correct?

7,45:13,,AP,Thank you so much for these wonderful teachings. Sometimes a very intense light nimitta arises and it feels like all of my energy rushes to my forehead.

7,50:42,,AP,"Following this morning’s talk on non-self, do you have any advice for reflecting on remorse / regret in the context of non-self? Remorse / regret are usually not big in my life except in one area: that of missed obligations to others. Investigation in this area rarely fortifies or informs me. It usually triggers either a well-tuned system of aversion / distraction or else despair. I do have confidence in the Buddha’s teachings and so an inkling that this can all be dismantled somehow.

Is it correct to say that the Hindu deities are included into the Buddhist universe as higher devas, mighty but not omniscient and impermanent beings? I am particularly interested in Shiva, who for me is a positive symbol of cessation, relinquishment and play of the elements. I know that Brahma is mentioned a lot in the Canon, but what about Shiva?
