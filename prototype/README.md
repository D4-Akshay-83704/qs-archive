<h2 class="western">Introduction</h2>
<p>Ajahn Pasanno excels at answering Dhamma questions. I estimate
there are perhaps 100 hours of his question and answer sessions
posted online. If you have a Dhamma question, it&rsquo;s likely that
Ajahn Pasanno has spoken to it in the past. But how will you find his
answer amidst the hours of available recordings?</p>
<p>This is a demonstration prototype of a search engine to answer
this question. The database contains transcriptions/summaries of the
questions asked and links to Ajahn Pasanno&rsquo;s recorded answers.
The questions are organised by event and tagged by subject. The web
design is ancient (hopefully you aren&rsquo;t using a mobile
device!), but it&rsquo;s enough to demonstrate the principle and
debug the database.</p>
<p>The principles described below are my best thinking so far. They
are open to revision if Ajahn Pasanno, Ajahn &Ntilde;&#257;&#7751;iko,
or the Abhayagiri Sa&#7749;gha object.</p>
<h2 class="western">Collaborators</h2>
<p>I created this demonstration prototype, but my web design skills
go no further. My nephew Owen (almost 13!) volunteered to design a
modern website using the same questions database as the prototype.
Owen&rsquo;s father, Michael, who once worked on the Gmail design
team, has already provided valuable advice to both of us. I have done
all the tagging so far, but I intend to invite online volunteers to
help with transcription and tagging later on.</p>
<p>I plan to update the prototype as we transcribe additional
questions and refine the tagging scheme until Owen&rsquo;s modern
website is up and running.</p>
<h2 class="western">Scope</h2>
<p>Initially the project will focus on Q&amp;A sessions with Ajahn
Pasanno, although we will transcribe questions incidentally answered
by other teachers in these Q&amp;A sessions. If there is energy and
interest, we might expand the scope to include questions and answers
from other Abhayagiri teachers or non-Abhayagiri teachers at
Abhayagiri-sponsored events. In this case, it would become the
Abhayagiri Q&amp;A Archive. However this is as far as the project
will go. We will source audio recordings only from abhayagiri.org and
Abhayagiri&rsquo;s YouTube channel. Perhaps others might create a
website to index Q&amp;A sessions from other teachers (see Copyright
below). An <a href="http://birken.ca/qaa/qaa.php">index of Ajahn Sona
YouTube Q&amp;A sessions</a> already exists.</p>
<h2 class="western">Teacher consent</h2>
<p>Not all monks and nuns want their teachings widely distributed.
Most monastics in this tradition went forth due to their experience
of suffering and faith in the Dhamma rather than a desire or ability
to teach. Monastics are generally introverts. A properly-implemented
<a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/economy.html">economy
of gifts</a> ensures that material support for monastics is
independent of teaching activity, and the concern is more that people
receive skillful answers to their questions than that they listen to
<i>our</i> answers. At the same time, a diversity of voices answering
a question can help the listener understand multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we will ask teachers individually about their
detailed preferences before including their questions in the archive.
If teachers prefer, they can review each question individually before
deciding whether it should be included in the archive. It&rsquo;s too
much to ask volunteers to keep track of whether or not they should
transcribe a question based all these factors, so the database keeps
track of which teachers have given their consent for what. The
website generation engine excludes questions accordingly before they
become available online.</p>
<p>This part of the software is already functional. As of now, the
prototype archive excludes two questions answered by teachers other
than Ajahn Pasanno because I haven&rsquo;t yet asked their
preferences.</p>
<h2 class="western">Copyright</h2>
<p>There are three distinct parts to this project:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>The audio Q&amp;A database format and the website engines
	that turn it into html code</p>
	<li><p>The tagging scheme partially based on lists from the P&#257;li
	Canon</p>
	<li><p>The recorded audio and its transcriptions within in the
	database and websites</p>
</ol>
<p>I need to confer with my collaborators and fellow monastics, but I
hope to license #1 and #2 such that they can be openly modified and
reused, perhaps using something like the GPL. However, monastic
Dhamma teachings usually use the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC
BY-NC-ND</a> license to prevent modification and commercial use. #3
falls in this category, and it&rsquo;s important to reassure teachers
that their recordings and question transcripts won&rsquo;t be reused
in harmful or undesired ways.</p>
<p>Most Abhayagiri publications are &copy; Abhayagiri Buddhist
Monastery. This seems the most suitable organisation to assign the
copyright to #3, but I haven&rsquo;t asked Abhayagiri yet. I would
like to consult with people more knowledgeable than I before deciding
on license and copyright matters. Thus for the time being, all newly
created material in the project is:</p>

<h2 class="western">Dedication</h2>
<p>This project is dedicated to Luang Por Pasanno (Tan Chao Khun Phra
Rajabodhividesa), my preceptor, teacher, and mentor. He has given his
life to continuing Luang Pu Chah&rsquo;s efforts to establish
Westerners in the Sa&#7749;gha and the Sa&#7749;gha in the West. He
founded and/or was a long-term abbot of all the monasteries where I
trained before my tenth rains. He sets an impeccable example of the
Holy Life well-lived, and I&rsquo;ve watched him handle many
challenging situations with confidence and ease. The epithet of the
Sa&#7749;gha, &ldquo;They give occasion for incomparable goodness to
arise in the world&rdquo; certainly applies to Luang Por.</p>
<p>Organising Luang Por&rsquo;s questions so others can find them
barely begins to repay my debt of gratitude to him.</p>
