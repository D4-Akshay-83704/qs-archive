## Krooba Ajahn

Although any monk may be addressed as Krooba in the Northeastern Thai Isan dialect, the term Krooba Ajahn usually refers to accomplished forest masters in this tradition. Ajahn Chandako compiled _Krooba Ajahn_ from conversations with and Dhamma talks by senior teachers from 1989 to 2000. He distributed this manuscript to many Western Ajahn Chah monasteries with a note indicating that he had not yet asked each teachers permission to publish the talks. It is not clear whether it will ever be published.

Abhayagiri community members read five chapters from _Krooba Ajahn_ during the [2014 Winter Retreat](../../pages/events/WR2014.html).
