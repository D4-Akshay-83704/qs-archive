On the other hand, devas have less suffering. Therefore they would be less motivated to practice to end suffering, correct? If so, would it not be better for one to wish oneself and others to be reborn in the human realm if one aspires full liberation?” [<a href = "../tags/human.html">Human</a>] <b>[<a href = "../tags/deva.html">Deva</a>]</b>

Is it correct to say that the Hindu deities are included into the Buddhist universe as higher devas, mighty but not omniscient and impermanent beings? I am particularly interested in Shiva, who for me is a positive symbol of cessation, relinquishment and play of the elements. I know that Brahma is mentioned a lot in the Canon, but what about Shiva? Also, since Thailand borrowed a lot from Indian culture, are there any devotional practices for Hindu deities, and if yes are they somehow integrated with Buddhism, perhaps on a folk level?” <b>[<a href = "../tags/deva.html">Deva</a>]</b> [<a href = "../tags/historythai-buddhism.html">History/Thai Buddhism</a>]
