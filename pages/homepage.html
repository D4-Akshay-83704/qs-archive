<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Ajahn Pasanno excels at answering Dhamma questions. I estimate there are perhaps 100 hours of his question and answer sessions posted online. If you have a Dhamma question, it‚Äôs likely that Ajahn Pasanno has spoken to it in the past. But how will you find his answer amidst the hours of available recordings?</p>
<p>This archive is an attempt to make the oral teachings of Ajahn Pasanno more accessible. It contains transcriptions/summaries of questions asked and audio recordings of Ajahn Pasanno‚Äôs answers. The questions are organized by event and tagged by subject. The stories Ajahn Pasanno tells in the course of answering Dhamma questions are often as valuable as the questions themselves. Thus I expanded the archive to include stories, quotes, readings, sutta references, and other content in addition to questions and answers. Ajahn Pasanno readily shares the teaching seat with other Abhayagiri residents and invited guests, and the archive includes material from those who teach alongside him.</p>
<h2 id="website">Website</h2>
<p>This website is a series of static pages generated from the archive database. It currently contains over 1,000 excerpts from more than two dozen events. I originally conceived of it as a prototype stepping stone to a modern search-driven website created by someone with more web skills. However, with a css makeover by Chris Claudius and a floating media player created by my nephew Owen, the prototype began to look and work well enough to publish. It would benefit greatly from a text search feature if anyone has the skill and time to contribute one.</p>
<h2 id="dedication">Dedication</h2>
<p>This project is dedicated to Luang Por Pasanno (Tan Chao Khun Phra Rajabodhividesa), my preceptor, teacher, and mentor. He has given his life to continuing Luang Pu Chah‚Äôs efforts to establish Westerners in the Sa·πÖgha and the Sa·πÖgha in the West. He founded and/or was a long-term abbot of all the monasteries where I trained before my tenth rains. He sets an impeccable example of the Holy Life well-lived, and I‚Äôve watched him handle many challenging situations with confidence and ease. The epithet of the Sa·πÖgha, ‚ÄúThey give occasion for incomparable goodness to arise in the world,‚Äù certainly applies to Luang Por.</p>
<p>Organising Luang Por‚Äôs questions and stories so others can find them barely begins to repay my debt of gratitude to him.</p>
