Ajahn Jundee compiled _Twigs and Branches of the Bodhinyana_ in December 2012 for the opening of the Ajahn Chah Sala at Wat Pah Amphawan. The title of the book refers to Ajahn Chah's Chao Khun title, Phra Bodhinyana Thera. The book is a series of short interviews and excerpts from talks regarding monks' experiences of being with Ajahn Chah. Over 90 of Ajahn Chah's disciples contibuted to the book; their contributions are organized by seniority.

Abhayagiri community members read draft translations of five sections of _Twigs and Branches of the Bodhinyana_ during the [2014 Winter Retreat](event:WR2014). A full translation of this book into English would be a substantial contribution to the Western Ajahn Chah Saṅgha.
