![Cover of Twigs and Branches of the Bodhinyana](../../pages/images/TwigsAndBranchesCover.jpg)

Ajahn Jundee compiled _Twigs and Branches of the Bodhinyana_ in December 2012 for the opening of the Ajahn Chah Sala at Wat Pah Amphawan. This book is a series of short interviews and excerpts from talks regarding monks' experiences of being with Ajahn Chah. Over XX(?) of Ajahn Chah's disciples contibuted to the book; their contributions are organized by seniority.

Abhayagiri community members read draft translations of five sections of _Twigs and Branches of the Bodhinyana_ during the [2014 Winter Retreat](../../pages/events/WR2014.html).
