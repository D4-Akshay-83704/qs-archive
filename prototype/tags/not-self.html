Surely we investigate the created to separate from it – But can we investigate the uncreated? And if so, is it not to identify with it?”

Remorse / regret are usually not big in my life except in one area: that of missed obligations to others. Investigation in this area rarely fortifies or informs me. It usually triggers either a well-tuned system of aversion / distraction or else despair. I do have confidence in the Buddha’s teachings and so an inkling that this can all be dismantled somehow. It’s quite a small inkle but it did try to get my attention this morning so any reflections or directions are deeply appreciated.” [<a href = "../tags/restlessness-and-worry.html">Restlessness and worry</a>]

I am wondering, is the self attachment? But attachment is not permanent either. So could we say the self can be either attachment and/or non-attachment, the owner or non-owner? Not trying to find self, rather understanding self? Perhaps pure self as opposed to impure self? Please comment.” [<a href = "../tags/consciousness.html">Consciousness</a>] [<a href = "../tags/nutriment.html">Nutriment</a>]
