  The Abhayagiri Monastic Thanksgiving retreat was traditionally an annual ten-day residential retreat held at the Angela Center in Santa Rosa, California during the week of Thanksgiving. However, after the Angela Center closed due to fire damage in 2017 and the COVID pandemic began in 2020, the location, date, duration, and format of this retreat have varied significantly.

On the other hand, devas have less suffering. Therefore they would be less motivated to practice to end suffering, correct?

Sometimes, I get a feeling of a great, expansive happiness like the realization that this practice actually works. It's exciting and empowering but I'm not jumping up and down.
