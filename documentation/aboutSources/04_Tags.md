# Tags
The archive uses a hierarchical scheme to organize the over 300 tags it employs. This scheme follows the structure of the PƒÅli teachings when possible, but I have needed to invent new categories for modern subjects. Mirroring the structure of the teachings, individual tags often appear multiple times in the hierarchy. For example, [Equanimity](tag:) (upekkha) appears as a factor of [Right Concentration](tag:) and in the lists of [Factors of Awakening](tag:), [Divine Abidings](tag:), and [Perfections](tag:). One can explore the tag hierarchy by starting with the [root tags](drilldown:) and successively expanding them to reveal the subtags they contain.

## Tag Structure

The superstructure of the tagging scheme can be understood by examining this grouping of the 16 root tags:
