Introductory Talk
January 6: Ajahn Pasanno, “No Bargaining with the King of Death.”
Ajahn Pasanno begins the retreat by encouraging us to return to the basics of the Noble Eight-fold Path. He mentions Iris Landsberg, a long-standing lay supporter dying of lung cancer, both to set the tone for the monk's final visit to her and to encourage us to practice while there is still time. Iris passed away February 1, 2014.

Questions:
(27:01) Where was this Dhamma talk given?
(30:21) Luang Ta Mahā Boowa often says, “You kill the kilesas” whereas Ajahn Chah in this talk speaks of the path doing battle with the kilesas. Is this just the translation?
(33:03) Is this talk a response to the vipassanā movement in Thailand?

(37:48) What does “the longing for the good is the cause of the trouble” mean?
(44:03) This reminds me of the phrase “possessing goodness.”
(45:16) Is this similar to the Buddha's teaching to let go of the path?
(46:55) Ajahn Pasanno describes Ajahn Mun's skillful use of language.
January 25: Ajahn Mahā Boowa, “Visions of a Samaṇa” from Samaṇa (pdf) pp. 11-12, 16-17, 18-25. Read by Tan Ṭhitapañño.
Ajahn Pasanno describes the title “Luang Ta” before the reading. Questions:
(17:45) When Luang Ta Maha Boowa says he's looking for a sign or vision, what does he mean by that?
(23:51) Did any of the Western monks go to Ajahn Chah to ask about their dreams?

Questions:
(28:05) All the Thai Forest Masters give very clear presentations of how they were attaining/finding peace of mind. Is there much written about how Bangkok was reacting when these Masters were saying “attainment is possible?” How were the Thai Masters answering?
(33:14) What were the interesting practices you used so that you would get up as soon as you woke up?
(36:11) Did Ajahn Chah talk about how to approach the nimitas?
(37:37) Could it be useful if the object is clear, stable, and peaceful and keeps coming back?
(38:12) With investigating sleep, it seems sleeping less is an effect from good meditation practice rather than a cause; is it because there is less proliferation?

Questions:
(26:57) I am curious about ways to know if one is lying to oneself and what to do?
(30:56) There are photos of Luang Ta Maha Boowa looking very fierce and also photos of him looking very joyful, laughing, and the same with Ajahn Chah, a bit more stern I'd say. Do you think the same could be said of Ajahn Mun, not that there are photos but there could have been?
(34:33) What about Luang Por Dune, he looks so mellow; was he ever animated?
(36:24) Ajajn Pasanno talks about a senior Thai Ajahn talking about his trip to the US.
January 29: Ajahn Dtun, “The Spirit of a Warrior” (unpublished talk in Krooba Ajahn) and Ajahn Baen, “Aiming to Look After the Kor Patibat” (14:56, unpublished talk). Read by Anāgārika J.R.
Questions:
(19:18) In the reading there was a lot of emphasis on solitude. Here we have a lot of time for that especially right now with our Winter Retreat, but we also have a lot of responsibilities and engagement in community. How would you recommend us balancing the two or using them to help each other?
(26:58) Do you have any advice about how to hold a particularly strong “fighting spirit” teaching, like Ajahn Dtun?
(32:20) I got more a sense of metta from Ajahn Dtun than warrior spirit?
(35:19) Ajahn Ñaniko speaks about spending some time with Ajahn Dtun in Thailand.
(36:45) I have another question about balance. LP Baen encouraged his monks to admonish each other, but Ajahn Chah said to put 90% of your attention on your self and only 10% on other people?
(39:16) Isn't there a story about when Ajahn Chah wanted to give feedback to a senior monk and he waited 20 or 30 years?
February 1: Upasika Kee Nanayon, “Reading the Mind” (partial, html) from Pure and Simple, pp. 163-177. Read by Debbie Stamp in honor of Iris Landsberg.
A brief biography of Upasika Kee precedes the reading. Questions:
(30:30) What Pāli word do you think Ajahn Geoff is translating as thought formations?
(31:25) In another Ajahn Geoff translation, I have seen him use “supposings” or “fashionings.' Is that the same word?
(32:16) Did Upasika Kee focus on vedana more than other things or was that just in this chapter?
(33:10) During her lifetime did she have a lot of followers?
(34:41) It seems that saṅkhāra is used by different people in different ways.
February 2: Ajahn Dtun, Unpublished Q & A session from his 2013 visit to Canada. Read by Beth Stef.
Questions:
(26:55) I'm interested in the theme mentioned of the body and mind being separate from each other. The questioner asks “Don't they have influence on one another?” I'm curious about how to reflect on that.
February 3: Ajahn Chah, “Kondañña Knows” from Being Dharma pp. 151-168. Read by Ajahn Pasanno.
Questions:
(40:32) The worldly winds appear quite distinct from each other, but status and praise seem closely related. Why?
(42:37) A stream-enterer is said to come back no more than seven lifetimes. Why the number seven?
(44:19) It's interesting that he equates the extreme of self mortification to aversion, ill-will, and pushing away.
(48:45) Could that “quality of knowing” be a variation on the teaching of sati-sampajañña, mindfulness and clear comprehension?
(49:25) Ajahn Pasanno speaks about the definition of an arahant being “one who is far from defilements” and also insight into not self.
February 4: Ajahn Thate, Steps Along the Path (pdf) pp. 3-12. Read by Ajahn Jotipālo.

Ajahn Pasanno introduces Ajahn Dune before the reading. Questions:
(26:53) Ajahn Pasanno, did I hear correctly the other day that you met Luang Por Dune?
(28:51) Was that when you had just become an abbot?
(30:18) His monastery is quite loud, isn't it?
(32:00) Ajahn Ahiṁsako reads another piece from the book entitled “Its Easy if You are not Attached” that describes the noisy nature of the monastery and Luang Por Dune's teaching: “It's the nature of light to be bright, it's the nature of noise to be loud."
(34:18) I was reading that Reverend Heng Sure found that his meditation object was particularly bright and clear when he was around his teacher Master Hua. I wondered if you experienced anything like that when you paid respects to various Ajahns?

Questions:
(26:59) With your meditation object, when you turn to contemplate it in terms of the three characteristics, anicca, dukkha and anatta, and that doesn't come up, does that mean you need to stabilize the mind more to see the object more clearly?
(29:30) How do I try to understand what the mind needs when I'm not getting insight?
February 12: Ajahn Plien, Mindfulness of Death (pdf) pp. 1-20. Read by Tan Ṭhitapañño.
Questions:
(17:00) Was he a disciple of Ajahn Lee's?
(18:40) In the Pure Land tradition, there are practices that prepare one for death. Are there are specific recommendations that yourself or Ajahn Chah would give for preparation for that last moment before death?
February 13: Ajahn Toon, Reflections about Wat Pah Pong from Twigs and Branches of the Bodhinyana. Read by Tan Kovilo.
Tan Kovilo describes the Thai book Twigs and Branches of the Bodhinyana and its draft translation before the reading. Questions:
(20:56) Was there some consistency around how Ajahn Chah taught monks in a large community and how he taught monks in a small community? It sounds like when there were eleven monks he was very involved.
(21:26) Was Ajahn Jun around when you were training?
(23:32) Did Ajahn Jayasaro spend a Rains Retreat with Ajahn Koon?

February 17: Upasika Kee Nanayon, “Breath Meditation Condensed” from An Unentangled Knowing (pdf) pp. 29-36. Read by Tan Khemako.
Questions:
(25:06) I recall hearing about some aspects of the korwat at Upasika Kee's center, do you know any of those particular details?
(25:46) Was it a women only center or separated between men and women?
(26:16) Do you think all those rules were written down like Ajahn Chah regulations?
(27:56) Did she have any well-known disciples that went on to do other things?
(28:51) It's interesting with vegetarianism, some follow that and there are others that don't?
(30:41) Do you think the vegetarian choice at certain centers and monasteries relates to different temperaments or personalities?
(32:45) My guess is they were not smoking at Upasika Kee's, is that right?
(33:44) When she is talking about the mind at normalcy, her description is having the meditation object always at least in the background, constantly in awareness, being aware of the mind-state and also doing whatever you are doing, walking, washing dishes etc. Her emphasis is on cultivating it so this is something that you would be doing twenty-four hours a day. When Ajahn Chah spoke of normalcy of the mind, did he describe it in the same way?
(36:16) She talks about within this state of normalcy constantly contemplating the three characteristics of all phenomena occurring in awareness. To me that sounds like juggling a bunch of things!
(37:18) So the ability to hold the meditation object, go through your daily routines, keep an eye on the mind tone, and watch the stress flavor of all arising phenomenon seems like a fairly advanced practice state to arrive at and maintain twenty-four hours a day.
(38:14) She talks about making a story out of denying your defilements. Does the story of having fun denying your defilements come from that space of dwelling in that state of continuous mindfulness, or does continuous mindfulness come about from going through the suffering of forcing yourself not to enjoy anything?
(41:15) What do you mean when you say try something and note “it's not working” or “it is working?” How do you know it's not just another defilement sneaking in and saying “this isn't working?”
(42:59) Is that where when one isn't meditating per se but where virtue would come in to inform whether we have slipped or not?
(45:08) She talks about virtue being the other hand of discernment in the meditation experience, and whenever discernment discerns stress, virtue is what lets go of the cause of stress, that virtue does the disbanding of it. Is virtue an unusual word to use there?
(48:20) When the habit pattern of defilement is so strong, and even with the mind seeing the suffering, still the mind says, “I'm not going to give that up,” do you have any suggestions for softening that, for working with that?
(50:46) You were talking about the positive aspect of relinquishment, and that's what will motivate giving up, that positive aspect of giving up and letting go. When it's painful giving up and you give up, you can say, “Wait, I'm just focusing on the negative aspect of giving up, I need to switch my mind to the benefits of relinquishment?”
(55:09) Discussion about where there may be regret and longing linked to giving up something, although on reflection after relinquishment it can then feel like a non-event, no big deal.

(25:20) How does this relate to the concept of the shadow?
(28:35) I seem to make a virtue of laziness and don't quite believe the teachings about doing without food and sleep. Do you have any advice for me?

(42:31) If you keep chipping away at a theme of contemplation, you keep doing it, doing it, and nothing is changing in your experience, at some stage you feel this isn't working, do you just have to move on and try something else?
